PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

HAVING been requested by the Syndics of the Press
to prepare a new edition of the Speech as soon after
Christmas as possible, I have revised the whole book,
adding correcting and rewriting‚ as necessity suggested
and time would allow. Of the many shortcomings of
the edition no one can be more deeply conscious than
myself : but while I claim .the reader’s indulgence I may

add a hope that this second issue will be found more

full and far more clear than the former one.
