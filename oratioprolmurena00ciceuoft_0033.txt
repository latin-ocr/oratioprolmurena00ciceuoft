AD IUDICES.

i. 1. quod precatus ...... ] the open-
ing words of the speech post reditum
ad Quirites closely resemble these.
The MSS here give deprecatus which
will not make sense. The reading
indicated by precor and precatus
sum following is established by
Quint IX 4 ἓ 107, where this opening
is quoted with the remark creticus
initiis optimus. The presiding ma-
gistrate offered up a formal prayer
after the election. Compare Liv

’ XXXIX 15, sollemne carmen precatio-

ms.

auspicato] the ablative of the per-
fect participle often stands singly
thus. Compare Madvig ἓ 429 obs
1, Liv v 38.

renuntiavi] ‘declared duly elect-
ed.’ The consuls settled by lot or
agreement which should act as re-
turning officer at the elections for
the following year.

fidei] a correction of Lambinus
from the fides of some MSS. My
‘honour,’ ‘ trustiness.3>.-‹ Sorof well

compares the old form of words

quoted by Varro L L VI ἓ 86, quod
bonum fortunatum felixque saluta-
reque siet populo Romano Quiritium
reique publicae populi Romani Qui-
ritium miliique collegaeque meo fidei
magistratuique nostro.

magistratuique] que as often only -
with the last of the series. Two
more instances of this occur in this
very Section.

populo plebique] this phrase is a
survival from a time when the plebs
were a mass of dependent aliens
outside the populus = patricii, the
latter alone being burgesses and
engrossing all political power. We
find it elsewhere, as in the title of
adfizm x 35, 11 in Verrem V §36
and in the latter of the carmina
splarciana quoted in Liv XXV 12.
Cicero is here no doubt giving the
exact words of the old prayer. See
Mommsen, bk 1 cc 5, 6, Dyer, Hist ·
of Kings of Rome, p 30¹·

bene atque filiciter] also formal.
Compare Plin Paneg 72 nam quod
precatus es, ut illa zpsa ordinatio
comitiorum bene ac filiciter eveniret,
nobis, reipublicae, tibi.
