possum ida in te reprehendere, quod in me ipso et praetore

bonas gratias cum optima existimatione attulit. habuit pro-

lites etc] if you have assessed the
amount of the restitution to be made,
taking a hard view of the case. [In
the times of the empire the amount
was fixed at four times the value of
what was taken; in quadruplum,
Jul Paull V 27.] This seems to
have been confined to State cases,
and was quite a separate matter from
the verdict (iudicium). See in par-
ticular pro Cluent ἓξ 11 5-116 and
Ramsay's note. In Gellius IV 4 ἓ 2
we have a case of breach of promise

tribus] the electiori of consuls took
place at the comitia centuriata. It
is certain that long before Cicero's
time the centuries had been brought
into some direct connexion with the
tribes. Probably the same people
now voted in both assemblies, and
in bodies the organization of which
did not essentially differ. But this
is not the place to discuss what is
perhaps the most difficult question
in Roman history.

conficiuntur] are made up out of
borough- towns in Umbria. These
muni'cipza are the old Latin colohies,
planted as garrisons when Rome w as
gradually conquering all Italy. By
the Julian law of Bc 90 they received
the Roman franchise.

zpse] he ‘’madeachance‚ opposed
to dedit respublica. So Zumpt takes
it; but I admit that this is rather
forced; and perhaps Ernesti’s con-
jecture ipsa, adopted by Halm and
Sorof, is better.
