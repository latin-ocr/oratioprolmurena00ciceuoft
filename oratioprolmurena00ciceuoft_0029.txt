 

ABSTRACT OF THE SPEECH 25

words and forms which are easier to ridicule than to explain.
The proceedings before the praetor in cases of disputed title to pro-
perty are-foolish and absurd: the dependence of women, and the
maintenance of sacred rites, ordinances os our ancestors, have alike
been tampered with by these men of wordy wisdomN Yet they
often cannot tell which of two words is the right one, and so use
both. As 1 said before, this study has not the making of a consul
in it: it is too paltry, it does not confer obligations: it is tied down
to a certain time of the year, and is worthless beyond the walls of
Rome. It is a small, easy matter3 give me two clear days, and
1 will come out as a jurist. Again, oratory too is a pursuit far
better adapted for a public career than jurisprudence. Many a
Jurist has begun life as a public speaker and failed ; jurisprudence
was but his second string. Think of the exertions the orator must
make, and the power he ,wields when he has made them. A man,
I say, can rise to the top of the political tree in two ways,—either
as a soldier or as a public speaker. Ι set aside your undoubted
personal merits, Servius; we are talking of rising to office. In
times of war and civil strife, when confusion reigns and all peace-
ful pursuits are at a standstill‚ who form the bulwark of the state?
The army, to be sure. Then yield the palm to the sol—dier, er such
as he have made Rome <what she is. As for Cato's depreciation
of Murena's military services and his contempt for Orientals, I
can only say that it is not justified by history. 1‘f‚ Cato, you con-
sider the great resources and ability of <Mithridates, the' resistance
he offered to our arrns, his vast schemes‚ the investment of Kyzikus

and the sea-fight off Tenedos, the anxiety of thev Senate and people,
the glory won by Lucullus and Pompeius, you will change your
tone in reference to Eastern warfare. And Ι maintain th'at in it
Murena displayed the greatest firmness generalship 'and enei-gy,
and that this gave him as good a claim to the consulship as all
our civil business-dutieS. Oh, but when you both were elected
praetors‚ you were returned before him on the roll, Well, but you
have no agreement to that effect with the people. And who does
not know the uncertainty of the tide of popular favour, and the
strange results of electioris? Their whole working defies calculation.
But we know of two things that went against Murena in the prae-
torian election‚ (1) his having never given any public shows, (2)
the absence of those who had known his merits as a general or
