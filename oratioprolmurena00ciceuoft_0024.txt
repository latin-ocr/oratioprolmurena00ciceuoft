20 INTRODUCTION

put ourselves for a moment at that point of the case where the
consul rises to speak we see that

(1) He had been charged with inconsistency and with con-
doning illegal acts by undertaking the defence.

(2) Murena's life had been painted in glaring colours as
profligate and unworthy of the consulship.

(3) Murena had been charged with corrupt practices at the
election.

(4) Sulpicius had been held up as a model candidate, who
would have been elected but for these practices; and

Γ Cicero himself had supported his candidature.

γ’ It was clear that the first three of these points would only bear
very gentle handling‚ and (3) had been dealt with in detail by the
juniors. The case was otherwise with regard to (4). Sulpicius
had taken a false step when he made light of Murena's services
in the field: it was easy to retort on him with double force by
attacking the ‘nice sharp quillets’ of the jurists in a tone of
bantering raillery. There was also an opening for retort in (3);
for Cato had put forward the specific charges not merely as open
violations of the written law, but as opposed to the moral prin-
ciples of ‘the Stoic school. It was sels-evident that a playful
exposure of the unpractical nature of the Stoic paradoxes would
seriously weaken the force of those charges which were formidable
chiefly from the reputation of Cato. But no one knew better than
Cicero that the. real key to the defence lay in the political situation
of the moment. 'Catiline’s conspiracy was discovered but not
crushed: the ringleader was still in arms, the capital was thought
to be full of his accompliceS. There were then three lines of
defence to be employed.

(1) The commonwealth needs all its officers at this crisis :
but the meeting of the centuries for the election *of a new
consul before Jan 1 may be prevented by dozens of things
(e g religious scruples about an omen) :
therefore, keep the consuls you have.

(2) The man for the time must be a man of action, not of
forms and quibbles :

Murena is the former : Sulpicius the latter :
