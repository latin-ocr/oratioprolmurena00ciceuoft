PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

THIS book is sent forth as the best attempt at an Edi-
tion of the Pro Murena that with short time and pressing
College engagements I can make. Being familiar with
the speech from frequent reading, and having collected
matter upon many passages myself, I have taken the
best authorities as guides in the writing of noteS, and
striven to give brief but full acknowledgment for what
I have borrowed from them. At the same time I have
done more than borrow; the Introduction, with the
exception of B ξί, is all my own work; and in the
noteS, where a passage seemed to me to require fuller
explanation than had been already offered, I have
tried to supply the needful matter, while on the other
hand Ι have freely rejected such notes of former Editors
as appeared superfluous, It is to be understood that
I address myself to University students and to the

head forms of Schools,
