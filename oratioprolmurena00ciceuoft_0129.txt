his epitomizer Julius Paris. On this meaning is apparently based
the interpretation of our passage by Halm, who says, ‘The words
from perrogationem to szffragiorum introduce nothing new, but are
only a rhetorical addition explaining confusionem suffragiorum.
When Cicero speaks of a perrogatio legis Maniliae, he means that,
in desiring the votes to be taken by heads [mass-voting] instead of
by centuries, Sulpicius aimed at nothing short of carrying the Mani-
lian law indirectly3 for in a confusio suffragiorum the freedmen
were in fact placed as regards voting on a level with the rest of the
citizens! By this method the difficulty connected with the genitive
legis is got over, but no more. I arn therefore still driven to the
conclusion that it is best to keep prorogationem, a word we know
well, and which with no very great stretch of its ordinary meaning
may be used of a law which we cannot claim certainly to identify,
so obscure is the speaker’s allusion to it. The manuscripts here pre-
sent three forms, prerogationum‚ prorogationem, prorogationem.
Zumpt's remark on the last is, ‘omni codicum auctoritate com-
mendatur,’ which is far too strong. From his valuable list of the
various readings Ι will however extract a few instances which shew
how unsafe it is to rest solely on the MSS authority on such
points.

ξ 28. prolatis. one MS has perlatis.

§ 30. promulgatis. one has permulgatz‘s.

ξ 85. prorumpet. 3 have per(r)umperet.

§ 26. pervulgata. one has promulgata.

ξ 25. pervulgata. 3 have promulgata.

§ 4. peisuncti. one has profuncti-

ξ 4. providere. 3 have previdere.

ξ 19. profutura. one has prefectum.

§ 42. perfecit. one has praefecit.

ξ 44, praenuntia. 12 have pronuntia.

I sear that this Appendix is longer than suits the scale of the

book in genera13 but Ι felt bound to give my reasons for not

accepting views backed by the authority of Mommsen, Halm and
Sorof.]
