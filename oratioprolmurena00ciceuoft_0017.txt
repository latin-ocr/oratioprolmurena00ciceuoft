INTRODUCTION 13

Mithridates took Murena again to Asia to join the army of L
Lucullus. The* official dispatches os his commander gave testi-
mony to the great services rendered by him as legatus in those
victorious campaigns (§ 20).

Without having held the aedileship (ξ 37), Murena obtained in
65 BC the praetorship, again with Sulpicius sor a colleague3 but
had been more fortunate than the latter in the duties given him by
the lot: for while he had got the iuris dictio urbana, the irksorne
task of conducting the enquiries de pay-lgm had fallen to Sul-
picius (§§ 35—42). Already at that time animated by the wish to
bring the consulship into his family, Murena celebrated the
Apollinarian games, the conduct of which belonged to the praetor
urbanus, with splendour all the greater that by reason of his
having missed the aedileship he had found no opportunity of
winning popularity by magnificent shows. After the Praetorship‚
he received m 64 B c as p1opraetor the government of Transalpine
Gaul (ἕξ 42, 89). Before the expiration of his second year, leaving
his brother and legatus C Murena behind as his deputy, he re-
turned to Rome to accompany the triumph of LuculluS, and stand
for the consulship (§ 89, Sallust Cat 42). It having become no-
torious that Catiline's band of conspirators had decided to carry
through this election with violence, and to kill the presiding consul
and the rivals of their leader, the election appointed for the 22nd
of September was put off, and the consul employed the time thus
gained 1n forming for' himself a strong escort of young men, under

whose guard the election was held without disturbance (about the
middle of October) and resulted in favour of D Silanus and

Murena. For the sequel of this, see below on the trial and the
pleaders for the prosecution and defence. One thing more remains
to be said of the accused3 he was clearly a man of good temper
and judgement, if we may trust the account in Plutarch Cato 28
of his rescuing and protecting Cato in a riot, or 21 ἀποφυγών δέ
ὁΜουρήνας οὐ πονηροῦ πάθος οὐδὲ ἄφρονος· ἔπαθεν ἀνθρώπου πρὸς τὸν
Κάτωνα· καὶ γὰρ ὑπατεύων ἕχρητο συμβούλῳ τῶν μεγίστων καὶ τᾶλλα
τιμῶν καὶ πιστεύων διετέλεσεν.
