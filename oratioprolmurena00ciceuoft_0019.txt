Achaia in BC 46 (Cic ad fam IV 3, 4, 5); but he was greatly
troubled at this time by the state of affairs and the manifest col-
lapse of the Commonwealth (ad fam IV 1, 2, 3); in fact, though
taking part with Caesar, he was, from his slowness of disposition
(ad fam V111 10 ξ 3) and want of decided views (ad Att XI 7 ξ 4), ’
long unable to make up his mind as to the course he should follow,
In BC 43 he was sent to the camp of Antonius on an embassy,
which he undertook from patriotic motives, though at the time
suffering from severe illness. He died on this service in the lines
before Mutina, and Cicero with sincere grief delivereda splendid
eulogy on the life and merits of his departed friend, the speech
known to us as the ninth Philippic. His intimate friendship with
Cicero is perhaps best shewn by two letters that passed between
thern in the year 45 BC. Early in February Cicero had lost his
daughter Tullia, who died suddenly in childbirth. When Sul-
picius heard of this, he wrote to Cicero a letter (ad fam IV 5),
conveying with diffident and tender delicacy the consolations he
could offer in so great a trouble. Cicero replied (ad fam IV 6)
in a letter which, though mournful and querulous in tone, shews
how highly he valued the kind-hearted platitudes of his friend,
which, if not neW, were still grateful to him. The two letters
are well worth reading, and should be read by every one in con-
nexion with the ninth Philippic and the speech for Murena.

(2) M Porcius Cato, great-grandson of the famous censor
of the same name, was born BC 95. The main details in con-
nexion with his life will be found in any biographical dictionary.

“ He was celebrated chiefly for a rugged firmness of character, which
“” shewed itself early in him, and was further developed by his
acceptance of the stern doctrines of the Stoic school. A man

out among his feeble contemporaries as one who though with them
was not of them; For this reason he was unable to exert any great
or lasting influence on his fellow citizens: most admired without
following him. Cicero, who was intimate with him, seems to have
