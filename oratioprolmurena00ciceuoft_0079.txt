xxm 47] 'PRO L MURENA 75

quendi. quid ergo? haec quis tulit? is, qui auctoritati senatus,
voluntati tuae paruit, denique is tulit, cui minime proderant.
quid? illa, quae mea summa voluntate senatus frequens re-
pudiavit, mediocriter adversata tibi esse existimas? confusio-
nem suffragiorum flagitasti, prorogationem legis Maniliae,
aequationem gratiae, dignitatis, suffragiorum. graviter homines
honesti atque in suis vicinitatibus et municipiis gratiosi tule-
runt, a tali viro esse pugnatum, ut omnes et dignitatis et gratiae

gradus tollerentur.

haec] these provisions, i e this law.

is] Cicero.

proderant] Cicero's own course
was run. He is making out that
Sulpicius was the real author of the
severity of the Tullian law. He
was known to have advocated even
stronger measures, and this, says
Cicero, was a bad thing for his can-
didature.

confusionem su-ffragiormn] some

Α plan by which votes were to have

equal weight. ‘Mass-voting' as
opposed to the nice gradatiohs of the
comitia centuriata, but whether on
the plan of the comitia tributa, as
Zumpt conjectures, is not so clear.
Halm well says, ‘as the proposal of
Sulpicius came out in the course of a
debate on a new lex de ambitu, there
is great probability in the conjecture
that it was not meant to reser to
elections generally but only to fresh
elections held when a magistrate
elect had been convicted of ambitus!
Zumpt comments on the extreme
difficulty of ensuring a formal meet-
ing of the centuries within a given
time, which strengthens this view.

prorogationem] the extension of
the period of its application. Com-
pare ad Att XIII 43 prorogatio diei,
in a slightly different sense. Here
it is like prorogare imperium Phil
11 ἓ 24, etc. The conjecture perro-
gittionem seems more strange than
“c ear.

Maniliae] All we know is that

idem editicios iudices esse voluisti, ut

C Manilius the tribune carried in
67 BC a law concerning the liber-
tini, which was at once annulled.
But I doubt whether this is meant in
any way here.

vicinitatibus] this correction seems
necessary. It is in two MSS and Halm
adopts it. Compare pro Plane ἓξ 22,
23, pro Cluent ἓ 11, pro Rose Am
ἓ 15, auct petit cons ξ ‘²4- Vulg
civitatibus, which Zumpt refers to the
coloniae Romanae.

editicios iudices] named by the ac-
cuser, with power to the accused of
rejecting by challenge a certain
number: the most probable expla-
nation of this difficult passage is
that proposed by Zumpt on compar·
ison of pro Plane& 41 ; there were
to be 12 5 jurors, equites and tribuni
aerarii, nominated by the accuser
srom the register (album iudicum),
of these the reus might reject 75,

· leaving 50, also 2 5 Senators were to

be appointed, but by some other
means, and none of these could be
rejected: there would thus be a jury
of 75 in all left for the trial. [These
are distinet from the editi iudices, of
whom any number might be re-
jected, according to Wunder on pro
Plane proleg 111 iii 3, (though he
is not free from error in that article);
and there is no connexion with the
editicii iudices from particular tribes
who were by the lex Licinia os BC
55 appointed to try cases of soda-
licita]
