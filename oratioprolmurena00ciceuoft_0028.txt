24 ABSTRACT OF THE SPEECH

II confictatzb, ἓξ 1 1—8 3 ad quod velis negotium
(1) de vita Murenae ἐξ 1 1—14.

How weak are the charges on this score! the prosecution felt
bound to say something. As to his career in Asia, it was one os ⁴
hard campaigning: it was his duty to go ; and why should he not
adorn his father's triumph? Asia is Asia, Ι grant ; but whether is
the better, to avoid temptation, or to withstand it? the whole affair
is a credit to him. As for his being a mountebank‚ you ought to
know better, Cato, than to talk in that vein. The charge is un-
substantiated and quite out of character. You can bring nothing
against my client under this head3 out of the mouths of the pro-
secution I shew that he is without reproach.

Your claims to the consulship are very strong, Sulpicius ; but
so are those of Murena: 'you are just a match. Your depreciation
of his family and puffing-up of your own is partial and not based

“ on fact. Your family is better known to book-worms than to the

people. I count you as a sels-raised man, and all credit to you for
it. Ι did hope that my exertions had gone some way towards
stopping the mouths of the proud old families. Ι got the consul-
ship against two patricians. Why not? You were above Murena
on the roll of quaestors, you say. A mere piece of luck3 and as
quaestors neither of you distinguished himself much. Here you
“ widely diverge from one another. 'While you went through all the
labour' and annoyancesof a jurist's lise at Rome, Murena was in
the East, displaying all the most soldierly qualities as lieutenant
of Lucullus. Now Ι for my part had rather not have brought out
this contrast so strongly; but you have driven me to it. The fact
is, Sulpicius‚”men were tired *of you. ’ Ι have felt the same thing
myself. And clearly the soldier has far higher claims to office than
the jurist. Rome and all in or under it are protected by soldiers.
They are our guardians. You must not think too highly of your
’ learning as a jurist: your other merits give you far more claim to
distinction than jurisprudence ever will. The three great avenues
to honour must rank thus, 1 military skill, 2·the eloquence of the
statesman and pleader, 3 jurisprudence. The last'cannot compare
with the other two3 it is paltry, and your hidden lore has long
since been made public property. You now take your stand upon
