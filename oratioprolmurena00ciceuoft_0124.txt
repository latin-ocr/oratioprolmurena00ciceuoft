Verres ; and the context makes it certain that he means them for a
mark of luxury.

6. sternere does not imply the providing of the couches them-
selves. Compare 11 in Verr IV ξ 58 lectos oplime stratos, Tusc
disp V §61 in aureo lecto strato pulcherrimo textili stragulo, and
many passages in Plautus. 'Of course it may do so; thus Metellus
(chief Pontiff 243—221 BC> ap Macrob 111 13 § 11 says triclinia
lectis· eburnis strata fuerunt.

Now, whatever the passage of Isidorus may mean, it is of little
or no weight. The passage of Seneca proves that in the opinion of
the writer these couches were common and coarse, as being made
of wood. But Seneca, though a Stoic in theory, was notoriously
luxurious, and would naturally think lightly of couches which might
sor all that have been magnificent in the days of Tubero (who was
a contemporary of the Gracchi). Pliny shews that the Punic
couches were of considerable value‚ though not extravagantly rich
if compared with others used in his own day. In fact at the date
of the story (Β C 129) any metallic ornamentation of a couch was
rare and costly. It is not, moreover, clear that Tubero provided the
couches: and from the language used it is more likely that he did
not, for (a) stravit pelliculis haedinis lectulos Punicanos savours
strongly of a purposed juxtaposition for the sake of contrast, and
(b) he did not provide the tables, or they would have been coarse
and rough also, and must have been mentioned3 again (c) stravit
requires an accusative case, exposuit leaves the ‘tables' to be implied ;
unless then it can be shewn that the tables were rough and provided
by Tubero, I maintain that the presumption is that he did not pro-
vide the couches. Fabius provided the tables and couches (a great
many would be wanted, and no doubt some had to be hired or
borrowed), not splendid, but elegant3 Tubero put dirty skins on the
couches and common Samian ware on the tableS‚ and so I think
the story is understood by Valerius Maximus. -Lastly, what says
Cicero himself? his haedinis pelliculis praetura deiectus est.

The diminutive lectulos seems not to imply contempt, but the
employment of ordinary sosas (see pictures in Rich, Dict Ant) to
make up the large number of couches wanted on this occasion.
