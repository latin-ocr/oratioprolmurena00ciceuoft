INTRODUCTION.

A, lee Text.

NONE of the existing MSS of the speech for Murena are of
earlier date than the 15th century of our era. In fact at the
beginning of that century no copy of it was known to have sur-
vived. About the year 1414 the great scholar Poggio found some-
where in southern France a manuscript containing it, but in a
tattered state, and with the writing much defaced by ill keeping
and the effect of time. This he either took into Italy or copied
on the spot: certain it is that, while the‘ speech was at once

circulated among the learned, the old MS found by Poggio has
perished. The existing MSS are universally admitted to be of

little value ; and a careful examination of the various readings
which they present (in the full collation of A W Zumpt) has
convinced me that the comparative method is alone safe in decid-
ing textual questions. It is true that A W Zumpt is devoted to
one MS (Lag 9) and relies almost wholly upon it for the formation
of a text ; but he stands alone in this opinion and—I now think-
deservedly. Since my first edition I have read Halm's paper
‘iiber die handschriften zu Cicero's rede ‚pro Murena' (Miinchen
1861), kindly sent me by Professor Halm himself. I have managed
also to wade through nearly all the furious controversy between
that eminent scholar and A W Zumpt in the zeitschrift fiir das
gymnasialwesen (15th and 16th years), and to read a valuable article
by Dr G Sorof (ib 15th year) on Tischer's edition. The last paper
together with a small Latin pamphlet by the same author (1861),
forms a valuable contribution to the criticism of the speech, which
as Halm says has given birth to ‘eine kleine literatur' of its own.
Starting then as before from Halm’s text of 1868 1 have revised the
whole speech ε in a few cases strong reasons have led me to accept
