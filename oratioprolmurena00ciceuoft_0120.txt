A. On the spirit of Roman trz‘als.

Prof. Ramsay well remarks, ‘the moral feeling which prevailed
in a Roman court of justice was entirely at variance with the prin-
ciples which rule our own.' It may be well to draw out shortly
some of the main differences.

1. There was no class of professional advocates, taking sees
and living by their profession. Any citizen could come forward to
accuse or defend any other: and, as a high reputation for able
pleading helped a man in rising to official distinction, many did

. so (pro Mur ἐξ 8, 24). It was also a great advantage to have the
power of addressing assemblies with effect (pro Mur ξ 24). This ⁷

naturally led to the introduction of irrelevant matter into speeches
in court (see the partitio ἓ 11, where the irrelevance of two of the ·
heads is manifest), particularly allusions to the situation of affairs
at the moment, and the probable effect on them of the condemna-
* tion or acquittal of the accused (see Introduction C and 1 in
Verrem ἐξ 10, 15, 17, 20).

2. It not unfrequently happened that a corrupt collusion existed
between the accuser and accused. For a sum of money or some
other consideration the former would play into the hands of the
latter, suppressing evidence and making only a feeble attack upon
him. This was called praevaricatio (pro Cluent ἐξ 58, 87, div in
Caecil ἓ 58, etc), and was properly applied only to the accuser in
a public—that is, a criminal—trial. Hence the chief security for
an honest prosecution lay in the personal hostility of the accusator
to the rens (see div in Caecil §64‚ Tacitus dial 36, 40, Merivale's
History of the Romans, c 44). Numberless allusions shew this.
