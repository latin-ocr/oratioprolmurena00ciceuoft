creverat, altera, quod ii, quos in provincia ac legatione omnis
et liberalitatis et virtutis suae testis habuerat, nondum deces-
serant. horum utrumque ei fortuna ad consulatus petitionem
reservavit. nam et L Luculli exercitus, qui ad triumphum
convenerat, idem comitiis L Murenae praesto fuit, et ,munus
amplissimum, quod petitio praeturae desiderarat, praetura
restituit. num tibi haec parva videntur adiumenta et subsidia 38

qualifications for office.
