exclusively from the Senate. In that year the tribune Gaius Grac-
chus transferred the iudicia to the equites. This lex Sempronia
was confirmed and strengthened by the lex Servilia repetundarum
of Gaius Servilius Glaucia, probably in BC 104 or 100, intended,
it seems, to reverse a lex Servilia of Quintus Servilius Caepio passed
in BC 106, of which we know very little. But the lex Cornelia of
Sulla in BC 81 again installed the senators as iudices, an arrange-
ment which lasted until B C 70. In that year the lex Aurelia of
Lucius Aurelius Cotta introduced a new system. The juries were
for the future to consist of three decuriae, one of senators and two
of men of equestrian rating3 one of these two to be formed of men
who had served as tribuni aerarii. This last arrangement was in
force at the time of Murena's trial. [See Mommsen, book IV cc 3,

6, 10, book v c 3.]

C. On §62‚ dixisti: quippe, iam.

Here the MSS have dixisti quippe iam, the only variant being
Lag 9 which hasquicpe iam. All editors accept the correction ot
ManutiuS‚ quippiam. What I wish to point out is that this resto·
ration of the passage, though plausible, is not necessary. In ξ 74
we find ergo ad cenam petitionis cansa si quis vocat, condemnetur.
‘quippe,' inquit: ‘tn mihi'..., de fin IV ξ 7 ista ipsa qnae tu

Plane § 53, pro Caec § 55, on which Jordan adds de republ Ι §61, ad
Att v 15 ξ 1. Madvig on de fin V § 84 says ‘quippe is not used
ironically by Zeno, as though he were making fun of himself ;
it gives a strong affirmative answer, with a sort of wonder at any

doubt having been possible.' Ι believe then that in the present
passage we might retain the MSS reading, which it must be

granted is a strange corruption for quippiam, had that been in the
original.
