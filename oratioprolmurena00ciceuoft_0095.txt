erant eadem ista, quae te delectant, tamen asperior non est

illo gravior, sapientior? possum de L Philo, de C Gallo

dissolvenda] ‘relaxing.’ Compare
de off 111 ἓ 113 fraus astringit, non
dissolvit periurium.

severitate] Zumpt compares de off

vero] a strong affirmative, corn-
pare Tusc disp 11 ξ 26 vero ac libenter

it was used to add force in the last
member of a climax,

melior] purposely put at the end
like an aster-thought, as Freund well
remarks.

quod tu] Cato had with great diffi-
cultyinduced the aged Stoic Atheno-
dorus Kordylion to come with him
from Pergamus to Rome and dwell
in his house, Plut Cat min 10, 16,
compare also 4.

Panaetium] a famous Stoic from
'Rhodes. His intimacy with Scipio
and Laelius is often mentioned by
Cicero, ,e g de fin 1v ἓ 23, de republ

1 ξ 24. Also by Velleius 1 13 ἓ 3

His work περὶ καθήκοντος was fol· “

lowed by Cicero in the de officiis.
accepi] Cicero was born m Β C 106.
The word in Cicero implies tradi·
tion, as Sorof well remarks.
lenissimus] sc erat, which has
perhaps dropped out. Cicero can-
not mean that Stoicism rendered him
very gentle; rather, in spite of his
Stoic training, he retained his gentle-

ness. Halm. This I doubt. We ’

know that Panaetius modified the
harsh doctrines of the Stoics to a
considerable extent, de fin 1V§ 79,
and thus caused them to spread
widely and take deep root at Rome. ’

C Laelio] praetor BC 145, con-
ssulljffl. He had the nickname

apiens, was the bosom friend of the
younger Scipio Africanus, Hor Sat

the chief character in the dialogue
on Friendship which bears his name.
He did much to introduce Greek
learning into Rome and was inti-
mate with the Stoies Panaetius and
Diogenes of Babylon. With this
passage generally compare de orat
11 ἓ 154, de republ 111 ἓ 5.

eodem ex studio] so ἓ 75. ‘ Yet
of the same school.’

L Furius Philus] consul BC 136.

C Sulp Gallus] consul Bc 166.
