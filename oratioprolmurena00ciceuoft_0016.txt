time Ι had been previously compelled to ignore: but I have on the
whole returned still more to the MSS readings than in the former

B. i. Murena and leis family [adapted from Halm}

Our knowledge of L Licinius Murena rests almost entirely
upon the notices of his life preserved to us by his defendet Cicero,
The plebeian family of which he was a member came from Lanu-
vium and belonged to the new Nobility (ἐξ 15, 90); as yet it
counted no consulars in its ranks; the first member of it who
gained the praetorship was our Murena's great-grandfather(§§15‚
86). The town too had never as yet produced a consul (ξ 86).
The most celebrated of the family was the father, who after
having held the praetorship served with distinction as Sulla's
legatus in Greece and Asia.. After the treaty with Mithridates in
BC 84 that general entrusted him with the command of the two
legions left behind in Asia. In this position Murena got into
fresh complications with Mithridates 3 his successes were not
conspicuous, and were more than reversed by a marked defeat
which he suffered in the passage of the Halys (ξ 32, where the
affair is grossly misrepresented‚ see Appian Mithr 64). Sulla put
an end to the quarrel by the recall of Murena, granting him
however the honour of a triumph as though he had won notable
victories (ἐξ 11, 15, App Mithr 66). In this, usually called the
Second Mithridatic war, the son served his military apprentice-
ship under the command of his father (ξ 11). According to the
assertions of his accusers, the young officer gave himself up wholly
to a life of Asiatic luxury and lowered the dignity of Rome so far
as to dance like a harlequin in the company of his dissolute young
companions,-—charges which it is true his defendet repels as utterly
unfounded (§§ 11, 12, 13).

On his return from Asia, L Murena became, along 'with his sub-
sequent accuser Servius Sulpicius, a candidate for the quaestorship ς
but in the tenure of this office found no chance of specially dis-
tinguishing himself (§ 18). The fresh outbreak of the war with
