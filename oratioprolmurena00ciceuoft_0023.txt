JNTROD UCTJON 19

Though not born to wealth (Plut Crass 1) he attained by frugality
and judicious *speculation to a vast fortune, so that he was nick-
named ‘millionaire' (dives) and is spoken of proverbially (Crasso
invidere, Cic ad Att 11 4§2) as the wealthiest man of his* day.
He fell BC 53 in an ambuscade during an expedition against the
Parthians (Lucan 1 104), and is placed by Plutarch alongside of

iv. lee Trial.

Murena was tried in the latter half of November, Β C 63.

Wilkins’ ed of Catil speeches, intr ἕξ 18, 19); again, Cato had

The names of the pleaders on both sides and a short notice of '

being Lucius Licinius Lucullus (ξ 20).[Whether the accused was
guilty of ⁴the charges brought against him is not certain ; but from
the stress laid by Cicero on the political exigencies of the time
(ἐξ 4, 79), and the orator's own boast (pro Flacco §98‚ cf Quintil
VI 1 §3 5), we naturally infer that he was. At any rate he was
acquitted, for he held the consulship in the following year3s

C. Remarks οη tlze Speeclz.

Mr Forsyth well says ‘it is a striking proof of the elastic'
energy of Cicero's mind that, at the very moment of the explosion

distinguished by its light wit and good-humoured raillery.' If we
