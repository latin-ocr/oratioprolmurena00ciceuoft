voted in full, or were perrogatz‘. The new technical word needs
not offend the reader. [We are, it seemS, to render ‘the voting·
in-full as provided in the Manilian law ;' legis being a sort of pos·
sessive genitive] Now such a perrogatio would really introduce
aequatio gratiae ,· so would the confusio suffragiorum, which Dru-
mann (Gesch R V 446) well explains as meaning that Sulpicius
sought also to have the centuries vote not according to the property-
classeS, but according to thedecision of the lot [entsclzeidung der

looses, by which I suppose is meant that the order of voting was to
be absolutely settled by lot, the first class having no necessary pre-
ference} He adds that confundere is not found elsewhere in this
sense, and sums up to the effect that Sulpicius wanted two things
which tended one way, viz to aequatio gratiae etc. [We have only
to examine our authorities (given in Orelli and Baiter's onomas-
ticon, Vol 111 p 217> to see that our knowledge of the lex Manilia
de libertinorum suffragz'zlv is far too scanty to afford a safe founda-
tion for any theories. Our only scrap of detail is preserved by
Dion, who says that Manilius τῷ ἔθνει τῷ τῶν ἀπελευθέρων ...... ψηφί-
σασθαι μετὰ τῶν ἐξελευθερωσάντων σφᾶς ἔδωκε, but adds that the law
was at once repealed. If then we resolve on identifying this with
the law spoken of in the text, we shall be more likely to weave cob-
webs than to produce any sound conclusion. N ext we are driven
to explain the confusio suffragiorum in a way which sets at nought
the meaning of conficsz’o, and rests on an airy hypothesis which
itself rests on nothing. Lastly, we have to coin a new word, and
then to go hunting for a meaning to attach to it. The word perro-
gatz'o is found, according to Forcellini, only in a fragmentary in-
scription on a broken stone (in veteri curto lapide), too doubtful an
authority to establish anything with regard to the meaning, if it
even proves the existence of the substantive. No doubt the verb
perrogo means ‘ask in full! We find thus in Livy XXIX 19 per-
rogari eo die sententiae non potuere· But to coin perrogalz'o and
then treat leg-225· as a possessive genitive is a proceeding'l cannot
approve. We also find perrogo used of passing or carrying a law ;
but only in Valerius Maximus, 1 2 ext ξ 1 Minos tamquam ab
Iove traditas leges perrogabat, VIII 6 ξ 4 Varius tribunus plebis
legem adversus intercessionem collegarum perrogavit‚ and the former
of these passages is not in the author's own words, but in those of
