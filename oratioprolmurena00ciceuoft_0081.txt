XXIV 49] PRO L MURENA 77

tium, secessiones subscriptorum animadvertebant, quibus rebus
certe spes candidatorum obscuriores videri solent. Catilinam
interea alacrem atque laetum, stipatum choro iuventutis, valla-
tum indicibus atque sicariis, inflatum cum spe consulatus tum
collegae mei, quemadmodum dicebat ipse, promissis, circum-
fluente colonorum Arretinorum et Faesulanorum exercitu,
quam turbam dissimillimo ex genere distinguebant homines
perculsi Sullani temporis calamitate. vultus ipsius erat plenus
furoris, oculi sceleris, sermo adrogantiae, sic ut eiiam explo-

ratus et domi conditus consulatus videretur.

secessiones] going aside together
to talk over something, compare Ovid
met 11· 465 deque suo iussit secedere
coetu.

subscriptorum] those whom the
principal counsel has ⁴ with him in
the case‚' ‘juniors.' Compare div in
Caecil§ 51 non esse lzos tales viros
commissuros, ut ad causam tantam,
a me susceptam, milzz' creditam, quis-
quam subscriptor me invito aspirare
possit. The word originally denoted
all accusatores. subscriptio was the
signing of names of prosecutors in
the presence of the Praetor, by which
they pledged themselves to prose-
cute.

obscuriores] Halm in ed 1872
gives the above reading of this
corrupt passage, and it seems the
best. But for this use of obscuriores
Ι can find no parallel. ἓ 16 seems
nearest.

indicibus] see above ¹on ἓ 42 and
compare pro Sestio ἓ 95.

consulatus] Halm's emendation,
which I accept provisionally, as Ι
am sure that the MSS militum collegae
will not stand.

circumfluente] this reading from
MS Lag 9 and two others, is, I

Ι, believe rightly, followed by Zumpt.

Sorof prefers exercitum to ablative.
If the vulgate circumfluentem ex·
ercitu be kept, compare Lael ,ξ 52·

Murenam con-

colonorum] Sulla's veterans, set-
tled by him at Arretium and Fae·
sulae; their extravagance had re-
duced them to‚poverty and debt.
Compare in Catil ΙΙ ἓ 20, Sallust
Catil 28.

dissimillimo ex genere] epithet os
quam turbam. ‘A most motley
crowd.’ turbam refers to all his
previously mentioned comrades.

distinguebant] gave a further va-
riety to. As we say ‘picked out
with white' of a carriage, etc. So
distinguere orationem, de orat 11 5
36. retia maculis distincta, ‘ where
the empty mesh sets off the rope‚'
Ovid heroidV 19. ‘ Throwninto relief
as a whole by the presence of men
stricken with the general ruin of
Sulla's Reign of T error.’

homines] relies of the Marian
party, having nothing in common
with the rest of Catiline's supporters
save impoverishment and readiness
for violence.

calamitate] compare pro Caec ἕ 95
ut nihil de illo tempore, nilzil de cala-
mitate respublicae querar.

exploratus] ‘assured‚’ as usual in
Cicero. ’

domi conditus] a strong figure. ‘ In
safe keeping at his house,’ ‘under
lock and key.' Zumpt compares
11 in Verr 11 ξ 5.
