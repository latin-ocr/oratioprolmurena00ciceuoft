(1) Servius Sulpicius Q F Lemonia Rufus, a famous
jurist, was born probably in 105 Β C (Cic Brutus § 150). His
early devotion to improving studies was remarkable: he went to
study at Rhodes (ib ξ 151), and on his return to Rome seemed to
have'chosen rather to take the first place among jurists than the
second among orators (ib ξ 151). 1-Ιο is compared with Cicero
himself, and the pair are matched with Scaevola and Crassus 3 for
while Sulpicius, like Scaevola, cultivated his powers of oratory to
back a knowledge of case-law, his eloquent contemporary and friend
learnt enough of case-law to be a complement of his oratorical
skill (ib§ 150). He studied law under two eminent jurists, Lucius
Lucilius Balbus and C Aquillius GalluS‚ but soon surpassed the
‘ latter in painstaking accuracy and the former in despatch; com-
bining, says Cicero (ib § 154), 1110 merits of both in himself. . Sul-
picius and Cicero went up the ladder of office step for step (ib
ξ 156) : and as we know that Cicero held each office at the earliest
age permitted by law <anno suo), we can find the dates of Sul-
picius’ quaestorship (viz 74 B C> and praetorship (65 Β C) with
tolerable certainty. In both these offices he had sor colleague
L Licinius Murena (pro Mur ἓξ 18, 35—42). In BC 63 both
came sorward as candidates for the consulship of the following
year: neither had, so far as we know, held the aedileship‚ but

Murena had become popular as praetor urbanus, while Sulpicius had .

had no chance of winning favour. Resides, during the canvass it
became apparent that the latter had given himself up to the design
of prosecuting Murena for corrupt practices under the new law of
the consul Cicero (lex Tullia de ambitu, pro Mur ἓξ 5, 46, 47, 67,
Dion XXXVII 29). The result of the election was that out of the four
candidates (Decimus Junius Silanus and L Sergius Catilina being
the other two) the choice fell upon Silanus ancl Murena. The
subsequent rebellion and death of Catiline will be found treated
in the introduction to Mr Wilkins' edition of the Catilinarian
speeches. Sulpicius brought Murena to trial, with what result will
be presently seen. He himself did not attain to the consulship
until the year 213 C. In the civil war he took the side of Caesar,
and was appointed by him to the government of the province of
