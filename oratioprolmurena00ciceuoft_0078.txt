'74 PRO L MURENA

[xxm 47

nem tuam, si haberes nocentem reum, fortasse armasset, peti·

poena gravior in plebem tua voce
efflagitata est 3 commoti animi tenuiorum: exilium in nostrum*

ordinem 3 concessit senatus postulationi tuae, sed non libenter
duriorem fortunae communi condicionem te auctore cOnstituit.
morbi excusationi poena addita est: voluntas offensa multo-

rum, quibus aut contra valetudinis commodum laborandum -

est aut incommodo morbi etiam ceteri vitae fructus relin-

accused. For the whole of this diffi-
cult and disputed passage see Ap-
pendix F.

47 plebem] I agree with Zumpt
in referring this to the agents,
especially the divisores. See on the
last Section.

ffagitata est] was called for and
carried.

commoti] a feeling of ‘our occu-
pation 's gone.'

nostrum ordinem] since Sulla had
made the quaestorship a passport to
the Senate, candidates had practi-
cally come only from the senatorial
order. Halm.

concessit] ‘gave way to, ’ with no
object. Compare ἕ 57. Halm.
Sorof adds de fin 111 ἓ 1, ad fam 1v

fortunae communi] a strange way
of stating it. They had the option
of abstaining from bribery. But
they did not generally do so, and in
B C 67‘it was the Senators who had
opposed the hard provisions of the
proposed lex Cornelia of C Cor-
nelius the tribune, and had procured
the passing of the lex Calpurnia in
its stead.

excusatio] often employed to defer
the hearing of such a charge till the
accused entered on his office, and
was out of the law’s reach. If this
be meant here of the accused, the
penalty was doubtless, as Halm
says, directed against the candidates.
But it may equally well (and with
more likelihood, it seems to me) be

referred to cases of witnesses or
jurors falling ill. See below, qui-
bus ...... laborandum est, and note.
They often fell ill when a friend was
on his trial, and hindered proceedings.·
We know from Phil V ξ 14 that the
president of fhe court was not obliged
to allow the exemption claimed by
one summoned to act on a jury,
unless he approved of the ground
alleged.

addita est] that is, on the top of
their illness. So Zumpt takes it. See
Phil 11 ἕ 31 cur quaestores additi? and
Prof Mayor’s note. But I am rather
inclined to take morbi excusationi as
abstract for concrete (see on ἓξ 10,
16), and for addita est to compare
Virg Aen VI 90 Teucris addita Iuno,
Hor carm 1‘11 4 78 nequitiae additus
custos, on which Orelli well cites
Plat apol 30 e οἷον δή μοι δοκεῖ ὁ θεὸς
ἐμὲ τῇ πόλει προστεθεικέναι. If we
take it thus, ‘inflicted' will almost
express all that 1s meant.

laborandum] i e stand the wear
and tear of a trial' m court.

fructus] what the allusion here is

we do not know. Halm has a note ⁷

in which he refers to the punishment
of exile. But Zumpt rightly urges
that multorum cannot be the accused
candidates, and his conjecture, that
jurors or witnesses who stayed awsszy
because of illness were to lose some
privileges (e g the right os sitting on
a jury or giving evidence) for the

ἱυῐέιῖε, seems to me far more pro-
a e.
