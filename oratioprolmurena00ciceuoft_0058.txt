erant occulta, necessario ab eis, qui ea tenebant, petebantur 3
postea vero pervulgata atque in manibus iactata et excussa
inanissima prudentiae reperta sunt, fraudis autem et stultitiae

nam cum permulta praeclare legibus essent con-

stituta, ea iure consultorum ingeniis pleraque corrupta et de—

adding sicut dixi, ecce tibi, vindictam
imposui. This was a festuca or
wand, ⁴ symbolizing the hasta or
spear, the Roman sign of ownership.
Then the praetor told both to let
the thing go (mittite ambo). The
first claimant then asked the defend-
ant (as here), why‘he had laid claim
to the thing3 the latter answered
ius peregi, sicut vindictam imposui.
A went on quando tu iniuria vindi·
cavisti (since your claim is a wrong-
sul one), D aeris sacramento te pro-
voco [or L aeris etc]‚ and B rejoined
similiter ego te. The proceedings
then took the form of a personal
action, founded on the alleged neg-
lect of an obligation, and it was regu-
larly tried by a iudex or arbiter.
This was in iudicio, as opposed to
in iure, before the magistrate. See
Lord Mackenzie‚ Roman Law, part
V cc 2, 3 3 Gaius IV 5 3 and for dis-
tinction between civil and criminal
causes, Mommsen book IV c 10.

tenebant] ‘ knew‚' ‘ were skilled in
them.' compare tenet§ 22. Or
‚perhaps ‘ were exclusively in pos-
session of them.' Compare ἓ ἰ 5.

excussa] ‘shaken out,' ‘ examined.'
Compare de off 111 ἓ 81 ; Tusc disp
1 ξ 88.

fraudis] ‘ chicanery' or ‘pitfalls,’
as one who pleaded informally causa
cadebat. Compare on ἓ 9.

27 iure consultorum] This rare
form is certainly found here.

infirmitatem consilii] so Gaius 1

144 propter animi levitatem. Ulpian
XI 1 propter sexus infirmitatem et
propter fhrensium rerum ignoran-
tiam. But Gaius 1 190 ridicules
this latter theory, which however
was not uncommon.

genera tutorum] Sometimes a man,

- instead of appointing by will a guar·

dian for his wife in event of his own
decease, gave her in that case the
right to choose for herself: Such a
guardian was called tutor optivus,
and would no doubt be chosen as one
whom the woman could manage to
lead. But the most common way of
shaking off a disagreeable tutor was

this ε the woman got her tutor’s con· ⁸

sent to her making a coemptio fidu-
ciae causa ,· then the coemptionator
made her over again to some person
of her own choice. This latter
emancipated her, and then she was
only the ward of the man who had
emancipated her, her tutor fiducia-
rius. Gaius 1 114, 115, 166, 195.
sacra] ie privata, often great bur-
dens on property at Rome, in honour
of the tutelary god of a* family or

gens. In order to e‘nsure their ''

maintenance (perpetua), they went·- ’

with the property. compare de
legib 11 ξ, 47 foll, orator § 144.
Plaut capt 775 sine sacris heredita-

tem = an unencumbered property. ’· ··

From Paulus diac p 77 we learn “
that the proper title of an heir to
property burdened with sacra
was everrialor.
