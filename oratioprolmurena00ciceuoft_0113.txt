xi, 87] PRO L MURENA

corporis morbo tum animi dolore confecti, L Murenae, recen-v
tem gratulationem nova lamentatione obruatis. modo maximo
beneficio populi Romani ornatus fortunatus videbatur, quod

primus in familiam veterem, primus in municipium antiquis·

simum consulatum attulisset: nunc idem squalore et sordibus
ae a: confectus, lacrimis ac maerore perditus, vester—est supplex,
iudices, vestram fidem obtestatur, vestram misericordiam im-
plorat, vestram potestatem ac vestras opes intuetur.
per deos immortales 1 iudices, hac eum re, qua se honestiorem
fore putavit, etiam ceteris ante partis honestatibus atque omni
dignitate fortunaque privare. atque ita vos si Murena, iudices,
orat atque obsecrat, si iniuste neminem laesit, si nullius aures
voluntatemve violavit, si nemini, ut levissime dicam, odio nec

nolite, 87

obruatis] ‘do not drown the sounds
of congratulation still fresh in his
ears with the sudden voice of woe.'

beneficio] see ξ 3.

familiam veterem] compare ἓξ 15,

municipium) Lanuvium, §90, It
was an ancient Latin town among
the Alban hills. No distinction was
drawn between these old cantonal
centres and the coloniae Latinae,
save that now and then the latter
are spoken of as coloniae to mark
their origin. By the Julian law of
BC 90 all alike were offered the
citizenship. But Lanuvium was con-
quered in Bc 338, and received
the civitas sine suffrag io. The people
became municipes in relation to
Rome, i e they bore burdens, such
as army-service and the tributum,
but had no vote. Compare Momm-
sen, bk 11 c 5. At a later time,
before the Julian law, they had re-
ceived the full citizenship. Com-
pare ἓ 42.

squalore et sordibus] compare
pro Cluent ἓ 18, and Prof Ram-
say’s note. Here follows a small
lacuna.

vester est supplex] so· pro Cluent
ἕ 200 supplicem vestrum, div in

Caecil ξ 17 supplices vestri, 1 in
Verrem ἕ 53.

87 lzac eum re ...... ceteris] the
double ablative has an awkward
air, but the same may be said of
ἕ 23 (see note) 3 the real difficulty is
that lzac re=his desire of the con-
sulship, qua=his attainment of it.
Tischer well compares Tusc disp 11
ἓ 43 quod ergo et postulatur a fhr·
tibus et laudatur, quum fit, id aut
extimescere veniens aut non serre
praesens nonne turpe est? where
quod = toleranter dolorem pati, but
id z dolorem.

honestatibus] honestas is the quality
imparted by honores, as we say
‘distinction.' The plural in this
sense sgems to occur here only. See
ἓξ ‘212 4·

ita] ‘as I describe him‚’ lacri-
mis ac maerore perditus etc. ¹
’ si] ⁴if, as is the fact,⁷=ez'⁷rep‚ as
often, especially, as Zumpt remarks,
in perorations. Compare ἕ 90, pro
Cluent§ 200. pro Rosc Am ἓ 153,
pro Balbo ξ 64.

neminem nullius nemini] a
good instance of Latin usage.

levissime] so in Catil 111 ς 17,
pro Sest ἓ 145· ‘ To make the least
0 1t.
