APPENDJX 119

D. On ξ 75, lectuli Punicani.

The received interpretation of this passage is, that part of
Tubero's bad taste was shewn in providing mean couches for the
guests to recline upon at the banquet. I wish to trace up the
authorities for this view and against it.

1. Valerius Maximus V11 5 tells the same story, almost word
for word after Cicero 3 but in pointing out the offence given to the
Roman people, he says not a word about the lectuli as mean, or as
having been in any way improper3 on the contrary, he says that
the people punished the public scandal of such an entertainment
by voting against Tubero at the praetorian election, because it
thought non unius convivii numerum sed totam se in illis pelliculis
iacuisse, thus laying the whole stress on the skins.

2. Seneca Ep 96 (95) ξ 72 says proderit dicere Tuberonis
ligneos lectos, cum in publicum sternerent, haedinasque pro stragulis

pelles, et ante ipsius Iovis cellam adposita conviviis vasa fictilia.

He evidently uses the term ligneos in contempt.

3. Isidorus Orig XX 11 ξ 3 says lectuli Punicani, parvi et
humiles et lignei,· nam huiusmodi lecti ex Carthagine primurn
advectisunt. Humiles seems=not raised high above the ground,
perhaps even ‘unpretending'

4 Pliny Nat Hist XXXIII ξ 144 tells us that these couches
were inlaid with precious metals. One Carvilius Pollio was the
first to put silver upon dinner-couches3 he, however, did not go so
far as to overlay them or rnake them look as splendid as Delian
furniture3 he only did them in the Punic style3 he applied gold
also in the same style ; and shortly afterwards the silvered couches
were made on the Delian plan. All this ostentation, *he adds, was
expiated by the Sullan civil war. The ‘Punic style’ must mean
inlaid work. We see also that the date of Carvilius Pollio falls
before Β C 88 3 how much, cannot be inferred.

⁴ 5. Livy XXXIX 6 in speaking of the triumph of Cn Manlius
Vulso (Bc 187) over the Galatians, goes o'n to remark that it was
the Asiatic army that first brought foreign luxury to Rome. As an
instance of this he adduces the introduction of couches, with bronze
feet (lecti aerati). Cicero also, ΙΙ in Verr IV ξ 60, speaks of the
same articles as having been extorted from people in Sicily by
