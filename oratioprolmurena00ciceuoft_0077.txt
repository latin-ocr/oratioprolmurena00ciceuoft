. tionis deflexisses animumque acl accusandum transtulisses,

existimasti te utrique negotio satis facere posse: vehementer

errasti.

quis enim 'dies fuit, postea quam in istam accusandi

denuntiationem ingressus es, quem tu non totum in ista ratione

consumpseris ?

deflexisses] here we pass to a race.
The change of metaphors here is
vefy rapid, and does not appear to
me happy. te is in the MSS, and,
though against Cicero’s usage, seems
defensible. I believe that he is
thinking of the circus. ‘After turn-
ing yourself (like a chariot) out of
the course,' ie you were like a
driver who gives his attention during
a race to some thing off his course,
and divided attention was fatal to
your success as it would be to his.

quis dies] quis adjectival. Com-
pare Madvig § 88, obs 1.

in ista ratione] ‘in carrying out
that plan.’ Compare ξ 83, 1 in Verr
§ 34 tua ratio est ut secundum binos
ludos milzi respondere incipias, mea
ut ante primos ludos comperendinem,
11 in Verrem V ἕ 173 non est alienum
meis rationibus.

xxiii erat] ‘there was the Cal·
purnian law, with its provisions of
the strictest.'

Calpurnia] passed in BC 67 by C
Calpurnius Piso consul that year, at
the desire of the Senate. It was
strict, and quite superseded all the
earlier enactments on the subject.
It inflicted a heavy fine on the can-
didate who (whether successful or

' not) had employed bribery3 it also

deprived him for ever of the right of
holding office or sitting in the Senate‚
but allowed him to stay at Rome.

From a fragment of the speech pro
Cornelio and the comment of

Asconius thereon (quoted in Orelli
and Baiter's onomasticon) it appears

XXIII. legem ambitus flagitasti, qi'iae tibi non
deerat 3 erat enim severissime scripta Calpurnia.

sed tota illa lex accusatio-

that the dz‘vzkores were greatly op·
posed to it. Probably it contained
a clause inflicting a fine upon these
bribery-agents, perhaps also upon
other agents of different names.
Moreover one who had becn con-
demned for ambitus might regain his
former position (in integrum resti-
tuebatur) by procuring the conviction
of another on the same charge: a
principle of reward well-established
in Roman criminal legislation. See
pro Balbo ἓ 57, pro'Cluent ἓ 98,
Quintil XI 1 ἓ 7 . He would not
however recover t e fine.

gestus est mos] this was in the
meeting of the Senate at which the
senatusconsultum was carried lead-
ing to the lex Tullia in this very
ear.
y tota illa lex] the lex Tullia. It
probably followed the terms of the
senatusconsultum, given in ἓ 67.
Another provision is quoted by
Cicero himself, in Vatin ἓ 37 quum
mea lex dilucide vetet biennio quo quis
petet petitur-mm sit gladiatores clare

’ nisiex testamento praestituta die, also

pro Sest ἓ 133. It was a supple-
ment to the Calpurnian law, defining
the proofs of guilt more closely, and
adding to the penalties, (1) of Sena-
tors, i e candidates, ten years' exile,
(2) of the agents, an increase of the
previous fine. Moreover, any juror
or witness who pleaded illness as an
excuse for non-attendance, thus im-
peding the trial, was to be liable to
some penalty not now known. Halm
however refers this penalty to the
