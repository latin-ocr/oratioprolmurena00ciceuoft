been some penalty aimed at the jurors or witnesses offending‚ which
in the highly-coloured language of Cicero might appear as in the
text? As for Murena's illness, it supplies no such proof as the
above argument assumes.' Even if it was open to him to plead ill-

ness in bar of further proceefflngs, he may not have done so. As
Cicero does not mention his sickness until the peroration of the
speech, and then does so only in an incidental allusion by way of
adding pathos to his appeal, I am inclined to think that the more
probable inference is the reverse of that drawn by Feri-atius]

(3.) multorum, he continues, is opposed to fortunae communi
above: if that refers to all senators concemed‚ multorum may very
well refer to the candidates. [I believe Cicero to mean in the
former passage, ‘any senator may become a candidate any day,
and may—whether guilty or not—be put on his trial.' Hence for-
tuna communis is used. Why multorum should be necessarily
opposed to this I cannot see: and it comes in much better as
applied to jurors or witnesses than if taken of the candidates, for
which it is an astoundingly loose expression]

(4.) He urges that addita est can only mean ‘ on the top of the
general penalty an additional one for morbi excusatio was imposed.'
[This dogma I wholly reject. If the putting in such a plea involved
a conviction with sentence to follow, the man who pleaded illness
would be in a worse case than if he had allowed judgment to go
against him by default‚ which is to me incredible: if it did not, the
whole statement is nonsense. This difficulty arises from referring
the words to the candidates]

(5.) He concludes by pointing out that if we keep the reading
prorogationem we cannot, from the meaning of the word, refer to
the Manilian law about the votes of the freedmen. Yet had there
been another lex· Manilia on so important a subject, we must have
heard of it. He would then accept Mommsen’s conjecture perroga-
tionem, and look upon this passage as giving the contents of the
Manilian law. As the freedmen had in Β C 304 been banished to
the four City Tribes (or, as Mommsen and Huschke more pro-
bably assume, wholly deprived of their right of voting) by the
censor Q Fabius Rullianus, those tribes to which on the ground
of residence they belonged, might in a certain sense be rightly
regarded as incomplete until Manilius carried a law admitting
them to their proper tribes. After this it could be said that the
