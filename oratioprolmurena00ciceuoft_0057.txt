te revoco. praetor interea ne pulchrum se ac beatum pu-
taret atque aliquid ipse sua sponte loqueretur, ei quoque car-

going on, the praetor might fancy
himself a fine lucky fellow, and bring
out some remark on his own account,

him also.'

superstitibus] = testibus praesen-
tibus. Compare Festus p 305.
