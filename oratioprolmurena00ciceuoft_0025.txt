therefore, do not condemn a Murena, to make room for a
Sulpicius. ι

(3) The needs of the moment are more pressing than the
dangers of ambitus :
granting that Murena may have been guilty to some
extent of the latter, he is the very man to meet the
former :
therefore, ‚look to the more patriotic side, and aequit
Murena.

Such were the arguments which procured an acquitta13 and,
for aught I can see, they are very good ones}w It mattered little
that. they were irrelevant to the charge (see Appendix A): they
were such as Roman jurors could not resist3 and the object„was
to persuade these. As to the style of the speech, it displays a
decided archness and humour, as in the treatment ofjurisprudence
(ἐξ 19-30), and in that of the paradoxical dogmas of the Porch
(ἕξ 61—65), in the description of Sulpicius' want of electioneering
tact (ἐξ 43—47, cf Quintil XI 1 ξ 69), and of Cato's perverse refusal
to recognize ordinary practices (ἐξ 68—77, cf Quintil XI 1 ξ 70).
It is also remarkable sor its moderation. This is without doubt
due to the circumstances in which the speaker was placed. He
was pleading on the opposite side to Cato and Sulpicius, two
intimate friends 3 and it would not only have been distasteful‚ but
have weakened his case, had vhe given the rein to oratorical

the Stoics Cato—smiled, and turning to the bystanders said ‘sirs,
how witty our consul is ⁷ (Plut Cato 21). If we turn to the scornful
attack on the Epicureans in pro Sestio ξ 23 foll, we see how
different a tone the orator could take when it suited him: and
we know well that neither Cato nor Sulpicius made any difference
in their feelings or behaviour towards Cicero after the delivery of
this speech.

To give some idea of the opinion entertained of the speech by
a great critic, it may be well to mention that it is alluded to by

‚¹ γ Quintilian no less than sixteen timeS‚ most of these taking the

 

form of quotations in illustration of some rhetorical figure or
device. 'It supplies also a first-rate instance of varied expression,
for jurisprudence and its practice are spoken of by seventeen
different names (ἐξ 9, 19, 22—25, 28—30). The humorous appli-
