ABSTRA CT OF THE SPEE CH 2 7

and strict, you have been trained into a sort of> perverseness and
bitterness by the Stoic principles which you have imbibed. The
stiff morality of the Porch is utterly unpractical ; their paradoxica]
dogmas break down when applied to real life. Had you been an
Academic or a Peripatetic you had been, not perhaps a better,
but a gentler man : you would never have shewn such animosity
against Murena. Yet I think that with age you will come round3
you are now still a young man, and fresh from the study of Stoic
ethics. Even your masters do not expect people to act fully up
to their high-pitched theories. We have often seen that Stoicism
is consistent with courtesy and good feeling. Think of your great-
grandfather. The name ‘Cat0‚’ then, must be set aside ε let us
to the charges. You say with truth that a decree of the Senate
defines certain practices as bringing candidates under the Cal-
purnian law. But when you come to apply this to the case of
Murena you fail in each separate charge to prove what is the
real point. You take popularity to be a proof of bribery, and
hospitality of treating. You are impugning, not the acts of Murena,
but the usages of political life. Your criticisms on the morality
of entertaining citizens at election-time are carried too far, and
are diametrically opposed to Roman habits and ways of thinking.
You confound public munificence with personal luxury. Remember
how ridiculous Tubero made himself by crossgrained application of
dogmas ⁴out of season. BesideS, if you must be very nice as to the
moral bearing of every little thing, how about your own canvass?
Fie, fie, Cato, on your affectation deceitsulness and time-serving.
What would the Stoics say? You took up this prosecution, you
say, for the public weal. No doubt you mean well, but you are
mistaken. Mine is the side of true patriotism. Think, gentlemen
of the jury, of Catiline’s accomplices in the city. Do not play their
game: we shall want our two consuls for the new year. This is
a critical time: frightful plans are formed against Rome by her
own degenerate children. My magistracy is drawing to its close;
leave me my successor. Think, Cat0, on all this ; remember that
the plots of years are coming to a head now: see the danger in
which I stand, and give heed to your own. It is your manifest

’ duty to help in securing for this crisis the services of such a man

as Murena in the consulship.
