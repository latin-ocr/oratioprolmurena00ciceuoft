ergo ? acceptam iniuriam persequi non placetP' immo vehe-
menter placet, sed aliud tempus est petendi, aliud persequendi.
- petitorem ego, praesertim consulatus, magna spe, magno animo,
magnis copiis et in forum et in campum dedu-ci volo: non
placet mihi inquisitio candidati, praenuntia. repulsae, non
testium potius quarn suffragatorum comparatio, non minae
magis quam blanditiae, non declamatio potius quam persalu-
tatio, praesertim cum iam hoc novo more omnes fere domos
omnium concursent et ex vultu candidatorum coniecturam

44 magnis copiis] a company of
friends or clients usually escorted
a candidate to the Forum, where he
canvassed (prensabat), and on the
day of election to the Campus Mar-
tius, where the voting went on. It
was an object to secure as many
Senators and equites as possible. The
larger a man's company, the more
likely he was thought to succeed.
Compare auct petit cons ἐξ 16—18.

deduci] the regular word sor es-
corting a candidate. Compare§ 69
foll.

inquisitio] the hunting up of evi-
dence by a candidate. Here it is of
an unoffieial proceeding for the pur-
pose of having the materials ready
to hand. See ἓ 45. Usually of
the official search sor evidence
aster the charge had been sormally
made and received by the praetor.
Compare 11 in Verr 11 ἓ 1 1.

szff agatorum] see on ἓ 16.

declamatioJ‘ ranting' against what
displeases you.

persalutatzoJ‘ general greeting' to
all you meet. Compare persalutare
in pro Flacco ἓ 42.

praesertim cum] Madvig on de fin
11 ἓ 25 explains the‘se particles as=

‘idque cum tame-nx “stquamvzs ‘and
that though ' If so here, we must
take them closely with declamatio,
which must=‘ stopping at horne to
practise a speech against Murenass as

Zumpt explains it. But it seems to
me that Cicero was here Madvzgz'
securus and meant ‘ I do not prefer
the voice of sulky indignation to
that of general greeting, particularly
as people notice it and feel inclined
to vote against such a candidate'

See §g 24, 53, 11 in Verrem 111 ξ
127. Madvig adv 11 p 208 says that
declamatio is out of place here, since

’ it cannot: commentatio causae. Who-

ever reads Phil 11 ἓ 4² with Prof
Mayor's note will 1 think agree with
me that it can. He then remarks
that even if it could it would not
take place in publico ubipersalutan-
tur homines. Ι greatly doubt whether
it isa necessary inference from

'Cicero's words that he meant it

so, even if we acquiesce in the
interpretation of praesertim cum.
Still less, he adds, can the word in
Latin= zndzgnantzs clamor. Cicero
however 111 ad fam 111 1 1 ξ 2 speaking
of the crimen mai'estalzs says etsi
Sulla voluit ne m quemvis impune
declamarz (or declamare) liceret, which
comes too near this sense to render
such an assertion safe. Madvig
agrees with Bake in reading denun-
tiatio. I need hardly now add that
this seems to me unnecessary.
