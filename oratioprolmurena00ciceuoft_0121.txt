APPENDJX 117

to the would-be praevaricator Caecilius), pro Cluent §29 auditis
non ab inimico opposed to audiebant ab accusatoribus, § 42 erat
lzuic inimicus Oppianicus: erat: sed tamen erat vitricus (i' e he
would have shewn mercy even to an inimicas, on the ground of
family connexion) ; and generally the relations of counsel to clients
rested on grounds of personal feeling, div in Caecil ξ 23 magnus
ille dffensor et amicus eius (see pro Mur ἕξ 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 86), pro
Mur ξ 2 inimicorum impetus (see the remarkable plea in § 56).

3. Great weight was attached to the personal influence of the
pleaders (pro Mur ἓξ 58, 59, 1 in Verrem ἕξ 9, 15). This naturally
followed from what has been stated above.

4 There was no professionally trained judge to sift the evi-
dence in a summing-up. The praetors were changed from year
to year, and merely acted as chairmen of the Courts. With such
presidents, no wonder that irrelevant considerations often were the

most powerful in determining a verdict.

5. It was customary for the reus to wear old and filthy gar-
ments in sign of mourning to excite pity (pro Mur §§ 42, 86, pro
Cluent ἓξ 18, 192, etc). Passionate appeals to the jury, either
without allusion to the charge or assuming a client's innocence,
were also common in speeches (see the perorations of the two just
cited, the story told in pro Cluent ἕξ 58, 59, and Quintil VI 1
§36)·

6. Bribery (corrumpere iudicium) was common (see for instance
pro Cluent ἐξ 64 foll). In truth it was not guarded against with
proper care. The jury were accessible during the trial to the
agents of either party, instead of being kept away by themselves.

It will thus be seen how differently from our English trials a
criminal prosecution was conducted at Rome. We are not dealing
with the Athenian courts; but one quotation will perhaps be in-
teresting. In Dem de Cor p 230 § 15 we read τοῦ μὲν ἀγῶνος ὅλου
τὴν πρὸς ἐμὲ ἔχθραν προίσταται, ξ 16 τῆς ἡμετέρας ἔχθρας ἡμᾶς ἐφ’ ἡμῶν,
αὐτῶν δίκαιον ἦν τὸν ἐξετασμὸν ποιεῖσθαι.

Β. Leges iudiciariae.

Up to the year 123 Bc the iudices, whether single jurymen or
a number empanelled to serve on the permanent or extraordinary
commissions (quaestiones perpetuae or extraordinariae), were taken
