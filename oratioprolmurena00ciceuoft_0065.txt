quibuscum populus Romanus bellum gessit, hunc regern nimi-

pugnae certe non rudis imperator, ut aliud nihil dicam, cum
bello invectum totam in Asiam, cum pace dimisit: quem L
Murena, pater huiusce, vehementissime vigilantissimeque vexa-

q rex, sibi aliquot annis sumptis ad confirmandas rationes et
copias belli, tantum spe conatuque valuit, ut se Oceanum cum

Ponto, Sertori-i copias cum suis coniuncturum putaret.

xv nimirum] in apodosis, as in
de off 11 ἓ 71. Zumpt. Halm
looks upon nimirum as proving
that both words are a gloss, but this
I greatly doubt.

pugnae certe etc] here the MSS
present a hopeless muddle. I give
the emended reading of Zumpt,
which I prefer, and which is ac-
cepted by Kayser and Tischer.
Halm and Sorof urge that pugnarum
non rudis would be the correct
Latin to express the sense. Zumpt
in repIy refers to ΙΙ in Verrem 11
ξ 17 provinciae rudis, and Quint IX
3 ἕ 10 Where the sciens pugnae of
Hor carm 1 15 is explained as
:scitus pugnandi.

cum pace] opposed to cum bello.
He merely gave up what he had
seized: this was in 85 Β C, the first
’ Mithridatie war.

L Murena] left behind in com-
mand by Sulla in 84 B C and ordered
not to provoke Mithridates ; he did
not obey this and in the second
‘Mithridatio war sared ill (83—81
Bc) at the king’s hands3 here
Ἴ Cicero speaks with great oratorical

license.

repressum] so in Catil Ι ξ 30.

aliquot] seven, 8'1-7 5 Β C.

rationes] his ‘position‚’ both- as
to plans and material of war, in re-
lation to his enemy. ff Compare ἕ 4
tempestatum rationem. Or ‘ plans.‘
Compare ἕξ 46, 83.

{pe conatuque] I now accept this
slight emendation of Klotz, as Halm
has shewn that the MSS ipse is not

. to be explained in accordance with

either the facts of the case or the
context of this particular passage.

Oceanum] the Atlantic. Pontum,
the Euxine. i e, rule the land from
sea to sea.

Sertorii] for this see Mommsen,
book V c 1.

cullus and Μ ,ΑυῑεΙίιιε Cotta 3 sor
the full history of this war, called
the third Mithridatio, see Mommsen,
book V c 2. '

ita] ‘with instructions that while
the one (Lucullus) was to pursue

Mithridates, the other (Cotta) was

to cover Bithynia. ’-
