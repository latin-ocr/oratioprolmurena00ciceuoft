quae et mihi et vobis nota et iucunda sunt, disputabo. in

sunt omnia non‘a natura, verum a magistro. fuit enim quidam
summo ingenio vir, Zeno, cuius inventorum aemuli Stoici

Stoics to his countrymen. For the
phrase imperita multitudo see on

of a higher kind, ‘cultivation,'=
παιδεία. In Cicero’s time it is often
used thus, compare de orat ·1§§ 35,
71, 11 ἕξ 40, 72, pro Arch ἐξ 2, 3,
etc3 but Gellius XIII 17 (Ῑό) notices
the disuse of this sense in his time
and illustrates it from Varro. We
have still the phrase ‘professor of
Humanity' in Scotland‚ and a school
ot thterae Humaniores at Oxford.
For studiis with genitive compare
ἓ 2.

requirimus] :desideramus, ‘ miss.’
The use here is strange, and the true
explanation is this. We miss com-
passion. as an element in his charac-
ter, i e we think him hard—hearted:
but he is not so by nature, it is his
master's teaching that has made him
so. Halm paraphrases ‘we would
fain see otherwise. ’ Compare Quint

prus, a Greek station with some
admixture of Phoenician blood in
the population. He taught at Athens
during the 4th century Β c in the
frescoed Porch (ποικίλη στοά), from
which his school as well as himself
got the name of Στωὶκοὶ οι· οἱ ἀπὸ
τῆς στοᾶς. He passed into a proverb,
τοῦ φιλοσόφου Ζήνωνος ἐγκρατέστε·

and Kleanthes by Chrysippus. See
