ABSTRACT OF THE SPEECH.

Ι Exordium, (a) ἕξ 1, 2 to tueatur.
The solemn prayers I uttered as presiding officer at the late

election bind me to wish well to the candidates whose names I
then published as elected consuls. You, gendemen, are now the
representatives of Heaven ; I would claim your protection for
Murena.

(b) ἕξ 2 et quoniam to 10.
I have been reproached for undertaking this case : let me then

begin by justifying myseIf, that my words may have weight. First
I must protest against Cato’s Stoic severity, and maintain, that
as presiding consul I am the very man to plead for Murena. He
has a claim upon me for defence of his title to office. I have just
coped with Catiline3 is it not human nature to feel anxious for one
who is to meet the dangers I have saced? again, we must have our
two consuls to open this next critical year. What if I did pass
a law for the prevention of corrupt practices? May I not plead
for the guiltless? I dealt severely with Catiline, it is true, but I
acted perforce an uncongenial part: I do but follow my natural
bent in pleading for Murena. As for you, Sulpicius, it is too bad
of you to say that I act unfriendly by you; but I will calmly defend
myself. Did I not support you as a candidate? yes, but to expect
me to help in crushing Murena is really going too far. He is an
old friend and even you shall not make me desert him. Resides,
neither my professional standing, my seeIings, nor my conscience
would suffer me to decline the work of his defence. Look at your-
self ε who but Servius gives advice to everybody? How otherwise
would most men get advocates? I will not listen to such charges:
I will be gentle with you, but 1 will plead for my friend Murena.
