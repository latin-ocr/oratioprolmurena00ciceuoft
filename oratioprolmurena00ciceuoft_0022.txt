18· INTRODUCTION

These are stated in the speech with more or less sincerity, and
some serve as arguments for the defence. But from his own
admissions (see note on §79) it is pretty clear that only (f) and
perhaps (c) can really have had much weight with him.

(2) Quintus Hortensius, who seems also to have borne
the name Hortalus (ad Att ΙΙ 25 § 1, IV 15 §4), the famous rival of
Cicero in the forum, was born BC 114, and early gave prooss of
great talent (Brutus ξ 228). At the age of 19 he made his first
appearance as a speaker, and won the approval of even the most
exacting connoisseurs <ib ξ 229). His reputation increased with
his experience (ib ξ 3οῐ), and he became the leading orator of the
day. He was noted for almost preternatural powers of memory
(ib ξ 301), for intense interest in and application to his profession
(ib § 302), and for the nicely—balanced arrangement both of his
opening speeehes and replies (ib ξ 302). His style of oratory is
characterized as tasteful finished and rich, the result of great
ability strengthened by constant practice (ib ξ 303). He never
failed to bring out all the points of his argument and make the best
of his case (ib ξ 303). His voice was ringing and clear, his de-
livery pleasing3 but he was inclined to overdo movement and
¹ gesture (ib §2 303). He died in Β C 50 (ib ξ 229). He had ranked
above Cicero as a pleader until the great Verres case (BC 70),
after which Cicero stood out with a decided superiority (see I in
Verrem ξ 35 and Mr Forsyth's life of Cicero, ch 4, for the tactics of
the Defence in that trial). Cicero, when he became consul, changed
his politics and supported the party of the optimates. This is why
we find the latter pleading on the same side as Hortensius in the
present trial.

(3) Marcus Licinius P F Crassus, a contemporary of
Hortensius (Brutus § 233), with little learning and less ability, rose
by his diligent mastery of cases and by his personal influence to
the front rank of advocates (ib §233), a position which he main-
tained for many years. His language was terse and correct, the
matter handled with care3 but he lacked brilliancy of diction.
T hough he got very excited, he never betrayed it in his voice,
but spoke in a passionless unvarying tone (ib ξ 233), which may‘
perhaps be accounted for by his deafness ¹(Tusc disp v § 116).
