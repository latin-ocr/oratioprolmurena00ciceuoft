16 INTRODUCTION

valued his worth very highly, but to have generally looked upon
his plans as unpracfical, in fact as a useless protest against the
degeneracy of the times (ad Att 1 18 ξ 7, 11 1 ξ 8, lv 16 ξ 12, XI 7
ξ 4, and de off 111 ξ 88, de divinat 1 ξ 24, paracl § 1, pro Mur
passim, ete. . . . >. In the year B C 46, when the Pompeian cause in
Africa had been lost at the battle of Thapsus, Cato withdrew to
Utica, and after deliberation slew himself, feeling that he had no
further mission to perform. Even under the Caesars the praises of
Cato were sung by the poets in their choicest lines: see in par-
ticular Hor carm 1 12 35, 11 1 24, A P 14, Virg en VIII
670 ; a “speech of Cato when at the point to die' formed a fav aurite
rhetorical exercise in the schools (Persius 111 45): but his true
epitaph was written by Lucan (Phars 1 128).

victrix causa deis placuit, sed victa Catoni.

The following lines (11 380 foll) also deserve quotation ι

...hi mores, haec duri immota Catonis

secta fuit; servare modum finemque tenere,
naturamque sequi patriaeque impendere vitam3
nec sibi sed toti genitum se credere mundo.

And again (ΙΙ 388, 9).

......... urbi pater est, urbique maritus;

iustitiae cultor, rigidi servator honesti.
Such was the man who declared before this consular election that
he would prosecute any candidate whom he found to have been
guilty of corrupt practices as defined by the existing law (pro
Mur § 62, Plut Cato 21). But Catiline fled from Rome to join the
rebel band of Gaius Manlius, which section of the conspirators had
already raised in Etruria the standard of open revolt. One of the
successful candidateS, Silanus, was married to Cato's sister, and
Cato yielded so far as to spare a brother—in-law. The course
which he finally adopted was, to join forces with Sulpicius, then
getting up his case. The latter then gave up his designs against
Silanus, took Cato to be a subscriptor, and the two directed their
whole strength against Murena. Cato was at this time tribune-
elect. Though a Stoic, he was a fine speaker (Brutus ξ 1 18).

(3) Servius Sulpicius Rufus, another subscriptor in this
case, is generally represented as the son of the accuser. But had
this been so we must have found some allusion to it in the speech.
