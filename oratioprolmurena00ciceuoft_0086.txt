82 PRO L MURENA [XXVII 56

tatis nullam commemorare potuit 3 accusat Ser Sulpicius, ⁵
sodalis filius, cuius ingenio paterni ornnes necessarii munitiores
esse debebant3 accusat M Cato, qui quamquam a Murena
nulla re umquam alienus fuit, tamen ea condicione erat in hac
civitate natus, ut eius opes et ingenium praesidio multis etiam
alienissimis, exitio vix cuiquam inimico esse deberent.

57 respondebo igitur Postumo primum, qui nescio quo pacto
mihi videtur praetorius candidatus in consularem quasi desulto-
rius in quadrigarum curriculum incurrere. cuius competitores
si nihil deliquerunt, dignitati eorum concessit, cum petere
destitit: sin autem eorum aliquis largitus est, expetendus
amicis est, qui alienam potius *iniuriam quam suam perse·

quatur.

58 xxvnr. venio nunc ad M Catonem, quod est firmamentum
ac robur totius accusationis, qui tamen ita gravis est accusator et

sodalis filius] his father had be·
longed to some sodalitas or collegium
with Murena, and such sodales were
ordinarily expected to support each
other. Also theson was expected to
take the same course as his father.
Sorof would keep the MSS reading

lii.
fi accusat] this repetition is called
ἀναφορὰ, compare that of negat ξ
74, ηὲίίίεὲ 80, Verres 11 in Verr
11 ἓ 2 .

munitiores] sc rather than attacked.

praesz'dzo...exiti0] Roby Lat Gr
11 xxv—lvi.

etiam alienissimis] compare ἕξ 8,
57 desultorius] sc equus, a horse
trained for the performance of the
desultor in the circus. This person
usually had two horses under com-
mand, Propert V (IV) 2 35 eius
traicit alterno qui leve pondus equo,
compare Liv XXIII 29. These per-
formances rank below the quadrigae,
so that what Cicero means is, that

Postumus, a candidate sor an office
inferior to the consulship, had bet-

ter have lefteandidates, for the latter

to settle their own affairs. Compare
also Suet Julius 39, Liv XL1V 9.

digm'tan' ete] either they did not

bribe‚ in which case Postumus has
confessed their sup'eriority; or they
did, and then what a hearty friend
is he who avenges the wrongs done
to a friend rather than those done
to himself ; the point of the banter
is that Postumus had better have
taken his late defeat good-humour-
edly. Compare 11 in Verrem 111
ξ 169 honestius est alienis iniuriis
quam (re) sua commoveri.

amicis] ie he must *be a very

useful friend3 irony, as he was hard .

on Murena, compare ἓ 56. So
Zumpt after MS Lag 9, better than
amicus. Halm after O Heine now
reads amicus ei, i e, Postumus needs
another Postumus.

SERVH] sc criminibus. These titles ·
are added by Cicero himself, like <

.οψ, ..- μ-..»“ .
