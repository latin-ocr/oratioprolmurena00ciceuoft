44 . PRO L MURENA ’ [VIII 18

18 neque inimici neque invidi defuissent. omittamus igitur de
genere dicere, cuius est magna in utroque dignitas : videamus
cetera. ⁴

‘quaesturam una petiit et sum⁴ ego factus prior.² non est
respondendum ad omnia. neque enim vestrum quemquam
fugit, cum multi pares dignitate fiant, unus ,autem' primum
locum solus possit obtinere, non eundem esse ordinem digni-
tatis et renuntiationis, propterea quod renuntiatio gradus habet,
dignitas autem est persaepe eadem omniurn. sed quaestura
utriusque propemodum pari momento sortis fuit. habuit hic
lege Titia provinciam tacitam et quietam, tu illam, cui, cum

18. cetera] these are, (1) quaes·
torship, § 18 ; (2) presence and
absence, peace and war, ἐξ 19--343
(3) praetorship‚ ἐξ 35—42 ; (4) can-
didature for the consulship ἓξ 4 3—5 3.

sactus prior] ie 1 got the re-
quired number of votes (18 out of
3 5 tribes) before Murena, and hence
according to custom was returned
elected before him. So fiant, ‘ are
elected,’ compare ἓ 50 factus, §45

accam.

f locum] Mommsen's conjecture,
accepted by Halm, Tischer, and
Sorof. Zumpt reads with the MSS
primum only, or (see Gellius X 1
ἓ 6) primo.

pari momento sortis] ‘ was about
Α as lucky for one as the other.' mo-
mentum=what turns the scale, com-
pare Lucan, IV 819, momentumque
fuit mutatus Curio rerum. Zumpt
gives another instance of the ablative
(? locafive), de invent 11 ξ 77; but
the genitive magni momenti est is
commoner. Compare on ξ 5.

lege Titia] is supposed to have
dealt with the duties assigned to
the various quaestors and the dis-
tribution of these charges (provin-
ciae) among the quaestors of the
year. But nothing is known con-
cerning it.

tacitam et quietam] probably calles.

Both Murena and Sulpicius had
a provincia Italica ; there were 4
of these, viz (ι) Ostiensis, corn-
pare pro Sest§ 39, Suet Claud 24.
(2) Gallica, compare Plut Sertor
4, Suet Claud 2⁴· (3) aquaria 01
Puteolana, see in Vatin ξ 12. (4)
probably calles, the charge of su·
perintending trie remoter parts ot
Italy accessible only by paths which
were often mere sheep-tracks.1n
Tac Ann 1v 27 the MSS give Cutius
Lupus quaestor cui provincia vetere
ex more calle's evenerat, and Orelli
has shewn that this is better than
Cales, which is simply a correction
suggested by a note of Lipsius on a
passage of Dion Cassius. For the
sense of the word calles see pro Sest
ς’ 12, Liv XXII ¹4· In Suet Caes
19 we find the calles spoken of as a
provincia consularis in these words ;
igitur cum Bibulo consul creatur.
eandem ob causam opera ab optema-
tibus data est ut provznciae fictum
consulibus minzmi negotii, id est
szlvae callesque, decernerentur. As
for the supposed quaestura Calena,
its existence is affirmed by no direct
testimony, and· the ingenious note
of Nipperdey on Tac Ann lv 27
fails to convince me that there ever
was such a post.
