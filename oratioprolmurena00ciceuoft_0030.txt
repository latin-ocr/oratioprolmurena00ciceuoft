26 ,ABSTRACT OF THE SPEECH'

governor of a province. All this was reversed when he stood for
the consulship. You do not appreciate the force of the army vote
and the splendid games of Murena in gaining him the consulship.
This is not all : look at the difference of your luck and his in the
allotment of praetorial functions. He had all the openings for
winning popularity, you of giving offence. Then he took a pro·
vince, and earned the affections of many ; you were doing your
duty at Rome. Do not forget that a provincial governor can give
his friends a lift now and then ς yours were no doubt disappointed
in you. But to be plain with you, it was all your own fault that
you lost the consular election. You gave yourself up to prepara-
tions for this trial; and, as Ι told you, the consequence was
that your friends held back then, in order to support you in court,
the people would not waste votes on a man who gave up all sor
lost, and your own time was taken up with matters which in-
terrupted your canvass, You are fitter to conduct a trial than
to canvass for office. Again‚ your threats and denunciations in the
Senate in the debate on the new bribery law, the extreme measures
you advocated, and some of which you carried, all went against
you with the people. Above all, you made us afraid that Catiline
would be elected while you wasted your time on other things. Of
course people voted for Murena, as the only way to save the state.
Catiline was exultant, you were depressed : remember the troubles
we had had with that ruffian already; think of my breastplate
on the election day, of all the qualifications of Murena for the
office, and the tact he shewed in his canvass; and you will not
wonder at the result.

Ι must now deal with the specific charges: but first Ι will
remark that Murena is hardly used. The time and the accusers
are such as one would scarcely have looked for.

Now for Cato, the prop and stay of the gase for the prosecution.
Ι fear the weight he may carry with the jury more than the charges
he can bring. As for the weight of‘his character, I say that it
ought rather to incline the jury favourably towards the accused,
than to tell against him. Romans are not wont to be the slaves
of a great name and reputation. The accuser cannot be jury as
well. Beside5‚ you push things too far, Cato: naturally upright
