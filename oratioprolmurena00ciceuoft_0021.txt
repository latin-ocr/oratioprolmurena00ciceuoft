 

INTROD UCTION 17

Halm then is right in leaving his identity undefined. In ξ 57 the
titulus speaks of him as adulescens, and from ξ 56 we learn that his
father was a friend of Murena.

(4) Gaius Postumus seems to have been the name of the
third subscriptor, about whom nothing more seems to be known

than is to be found in the speech, ἕξ 54, 56, 57, 69.

iii. For tlze quence.

(1) Marcus Tullius M F M N Cicero was born at Arpi· ,
num Β C 106. To attempt any remarks on his character would be
out of place here. The facts connected with him which have most
to do *with the present case are these. In the year of his consul-
ship (BC 63) he was brought sace to face with one of the most
serious dangers that ever threatened Rome, the foul conspiracy of
Catiline. His watchfulness and energy thwarted all the plans of
the band of traitors, and without doubt saved the State, as he is
never weary of telling us. The story is written in Roman history

and needs no repetition here. Early in the same year, following
the declared will of the Senate‚ he had carried a law to supplement

the lex Calpurnia de ambitu, imposing more stringent penalties
and defining more accurately the practices regarded by the law as
‘corrupt’ (see notes on ἕξ 46, 47). When Murena was accused
of ambitus, the consul, to the surprise of some, came forward to
defend him. His reasons for this course were,—

(a> He had been returning officer at the election, and felt
bound to support the man whom he had declared duly
elected. ἕξ 1, 3. ’

(b) He had been exposed to great dangers in his own year
of office, and must needs feel for his successor, who would
have to carry out what he had begun. ἕξ 3, 4.

(c) Murena was an old friend. ἕξ 5, 8, 10.

(d) Murena was innocent. ἕξ 5, 67—77.

(e) One who had risen to be praetor and consul by his
efforts as a pleader could not refuse the brief. ἐξ 8, 9, 10.
(s) The safety of the State demanded the acquittal of the

consul-elect. ἕξ 4, 78--—8 5.
