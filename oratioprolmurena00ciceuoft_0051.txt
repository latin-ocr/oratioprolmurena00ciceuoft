1x 22] PRO L· MURENA 47

quarn ego, si mihi per Servium liceat, pari atque eadem in
laude ponam. sed non licet: agitat rem militarem, insectatur
totam hanc legationem, assiduitatis et operarum harum coti·
dianarum putat esse consulatum. apud exercitum mihi fueris,
inquit, tot annos, forum non attigeris? afueris tam diu, ut
cum longo *intervallo veneris, cum his, qui in foro habitarint,
de dignitate contendas? primum ista nostra assiduitas, Servi,
nescis quant'um interdum adferat hominibus fastidii, quantum
satietatis. mihi quidem vehementer expedit positam in oculis
esse gratiam, sed tamen ego mei satietatem magno meo labore
superavi, et tu idem fortasse: verum tamen utrique nostrum
desiderium nihil obfuisset. sed ut, hoc omisso, ad vstudiorum 22

atque artium contentionem revertamur, qui potes dubitare

ut] as though Murena had stayed
away on purpose, and put sorward
his absence as a claim to office.
The use is closely akin to that com-
mented on in § 11. Most editors
read et in defiance of the unanimous
voice of the MSS, a change which Ι

eadem in laude] One of the better
Mss places the preposition thus, and
I have therefore transferred it. ‚It
is usually placed before eadem.
Halm keeps it there, and accepts
Bake's conjecture parem for pari.

operarum] ‘jobsss perhaps with a
touch of the sense ‘day-labourers‚'
as Zumpt thinks. The plural is
certainly contemptuous; in ξ 36 the
singular is used.

harum = forensium. ’

apud...c0ntendas ?] loosely quoted
by Quintil V 13 ἓ 27. Here I have
taken the MS reading, but the punc-
tuation is my own. Compare Mad-
vig § 438, and for fueris subj ἓ 3 5 3,
pro Sulla ἓ 44.

milti] dat ethicus, compare § 13.

tot annos] goes with fueris etc.

the following coordinate interroga-

primum] ‘to begin with.' So in

expedit] so MSS, and it is far better

also I prefer to keep the MSS read-

verum tamen] catches up sed ta-

desiderium] Halm compares ad
Attic ΙΙ 5§ 1. ‘It would not have
been such a bad thing for either os
us, had we been missed awhile from
our haunts.'
